# JavaScript Injector
A bookmark that spawns a little box that lets you run JS in any page

**Bookmark this:**

    javascript:var%20d=document;var%20i=d.createElement('script');i.src='https://grosserly.github.io/js-inject/inject.js';d.body.appendChild(i);void(0);

I know you can just do this with Inspect Element but on some of the things I use Inspect Element's disabled.

Thanks to Alex Leone, David Nufer, and David Truong, the people behind [Katamari Hack](http://kathack.com/), because I used their bookmark code as a reference.
