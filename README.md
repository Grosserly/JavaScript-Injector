# JavaScript Injector
A bookmark that spawns a little box that lets you run JS in any page

<a href="javascript:var%20d=document;var i=d.createElement('script');i.src='https://grosserly.github.io/js-inject/injector.js';d.body.appendChild(i);void(0);">Drag this to your Bookmarks bar</a>

I know you can just do this with Inspect Element but on some of the things I use Inspect Element's disabled.

Thanks to Alex Leone, David Nufer, and David Truong, the people behind [Katamari Hack](http://kathack.com/), because I used their bookmark code as a reference.
